This means that calling\n   * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, the\n   * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n   * done.\n   *\n   * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n   * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n   * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`\n   * calls its callback with one argument the Observable will emit that value.\n   * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting\n   * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.\n   *\n   * It is very important to remember that input function `func` is not called\n   * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output\n   * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request\n   * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.\n   *\n   * Optionally, a selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. The selector function\n   * takes the same arguments as the callback and returns the value that will be emitted by the Observable.\n   * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as an array\n   * the selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as the callback would.\n   * This means you can imagine the default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n   * as a function that aggregates all its arguments into an array, or simply returns first argument\n   * if there is only one.\n   *\n   * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call\n   * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n   * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`\n   * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n   * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler\n   * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing\n   * will end before `func` is invoked.\n   *\n   * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n   * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable\n   * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n   * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n   * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n   *\n   * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n   * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n   * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,\n   *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n   *\n   * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound the context of `func`\n   * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n   * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context\n   * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.\n   *\n   * If the input function calls its callback in the \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n   * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n   * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n   * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters\n   * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n   * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n   * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n   * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n   *

just like {@link bindCallback}, but the\n   * callback is expected to be of type `callback(error, result)`.</span>\n   *\n   * `bindNodeCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not\n   * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n   * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n   * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n   * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n   * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n   * something went wrong.\n   *\n   * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n   * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n   * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n   * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n   * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n   * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n   * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n   *\n   * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n   * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n   * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n   * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n   *\n   * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n   * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n   * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n   * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n   * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n   * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n   * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n   *\n   * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n   * of returned function, when it is called.\n   *\n   * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n   * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n   * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n   * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n   * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n   *\n   * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n   * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n   * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n   * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n   *\n   * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n   * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n   * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n   * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n   * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n   * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n   * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n   * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n   * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n   *\n   * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n   * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>\n   * import * as fs from 'fs';\n   * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n   * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n   * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback

boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n   * boundSomeFunction()\n   * .subscribe(value => {\n   *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n   * });\n   *\n   *\n   *

If no input Observables are provided, resulting stream will complete\n   * immediately.\n   *\n   * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed Observables to complete and then it will emit an array with last\n   * values from corresponding Observables. So if you pass `n` Observables to the operator, resulting\n   * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first Observable,\n   * second value is the last thing emitted by the second Observable and so on. That means `forkJoin` will\n   * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only\n   * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}\n   * or {@link zip} instead.\n   *\n   * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of\n   * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well\n   * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.\n   * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,\n   * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to\n   * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all Observables passed as arguments\n   * have to emit something at least once and complete.\n   *\n   * If any input Observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other Observables\n   * will be immediately unsubscribed.\n   *\n   * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally\n   * would land in emitted array. Whatever is returned by project function, will appear in output\n   * Observable instead.

So for example if Node.js library exposes\n   * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still\n   * a good choice.\n   *\n   * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed\n   * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually\n   * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}\n   * instead.\n   *\n   * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:\n   *\n   * **DOM EventTarget**\n   *\n   * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.\n   *\n   * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event\n   * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,\n   * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When\n   * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n   * as third parameter as well.\n   *\n   * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n   *\n   * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n   *\n   * **JQuery-style event target**\n   *\n   * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n   *\n   * **DOM NodeList**\n   *\n   * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n   *\n   * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n   * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable\n   * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.\n   *\n   * **DOM HtmlCollection**\n   *\n   * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is\n   * installed and removed in each of elements.\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Emits clicks happening on the DOM document</caption>\n   * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n   * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n   *\n   * // Results in:\n   * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click\n   * // occurs on the document.\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Use addEventListener with capture option</caption>\n   * var clicksInDocument = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click', true); // note optional configuration parameter\n   *                                                                          // which will be passed to addEventListener\n   * var clicksInDiv = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(someDivInDocument, 'click');\n   *\n   * clicksInDocument.subscribe(() => console.log('document'));\n   * clicksInDiv.subscribe(() => console.log('div'));\n   *\n   * // By default events bubble UP in DOM tree, so normally\n   * // when we would click on div in document\n   * // \"div\" would be logged first and then \"document\".\n   * // Since we specified optional `capture` option, document\n   * // will catch event when it goes DOWN DOM tree, so console\n   * // will log \"document\" and then \"div\".\n   *\n   * @see {@link bindCallback}\n   * @see {@link bindNodeCallback}\n   * @see {@link fromEventPattern}\n   *\n   * @param {EventTargetLike} target The DOM EventTarget, Node.js\n   * EventEmitter, JQuery-like event target, NodeList or HTMLCollection to attach the event handler to.\n   * @param {string} eventName The event name of interest, being emitted by the\n   * `target`.\n   * @param {EventListenerOptions} [options] Options to pass through to addEventListener\n   * @param {SelectorMethodSignature<T>} [selector] An optional function to\n   * post-process results.

class=\"informal\">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it\n * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits\n * the output of that formula.</span>\n *\n * <img src=\"./img/combineLatest.png\" width=\"100%\">\n *\n * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as\n * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function combineLatest<T, R>(...observables: Array<any | ObservableInput<any> |\n                                                    Array<ObservableInput<any>> |\n                                                    (((...values: Array<any>) => R)) |\n                                                    IScheduler>): Observable<R> {\n  let project: (...values: Array<any>) => R =  null;\n  let scheduler: IScheduler = null;\n\n  if (isScheduler(observables[observables.length -

As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be\n * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that\n * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when\n * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription\n * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,\n * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of\n * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.\n *\n * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,\n * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source\n * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,\n * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count\n * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least\n * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a\n * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.\n *\n * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.\n * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable\n * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this\n * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If\n * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.\n * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,\n * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream\n * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,\n * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.\n *\n * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the\n * source Observable.

Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted.

Note that this fallback Observable is not checked for timeouts\n * itself, so it can emit values and complete at arbitrary points in time. From the moment of a second\n * subscription, Observable returned from `timeoutWith` simply mirrors fallback stream. When that\n * stream completes, it completes as well.\n *\n * Scheduler, which in case of `timeout` is provided as as second argument, can be still provided\n * here - as a third, optional parameter.
